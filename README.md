Sound distance mod [v1.0] by Cosmos
==========================
This mod only adds a function, which plays a sound with a different gain depending on the distance to the sound origin.
It can be used so players can know if they're either closer or further to the sound origin.

How to use:

sound_distance_play(pos, sound, sound_gain, distance)

Example:

sound_distance_play(self.object:get_pos(), "example_sound", 1, 16)
---------------------------------------------
See: license.txt for license.

Special thanks to TenPlus1, as the "get_distance" function is from mobs redo.

Depends on: default.
